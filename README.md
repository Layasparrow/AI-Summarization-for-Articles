 AI-Powered Techniques for Automated Article Summarization  

 Overview  
This project focuses on automated article summarization using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. By leveraging Google’s T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model, the system generates concise, coherent, and contextually accurate summaries of long documents, research papers, and articles.  

The project also integrates a Streamlit web application, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time summarization.  

 Features  
- Abstractive text summarization using Transformer-based T5 architecture  
- Support for long documents, news articles, and research papers 
- **Streamlit-powered web interface for interactive summarization  
- Evaluation metrics: ROUGE and BLEU scores for performance validation  
- Data preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset
